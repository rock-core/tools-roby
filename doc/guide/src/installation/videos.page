Normal operations
-----------------

Those videos don't show what Roby itself does, only results showing
robots (real and in simulation) acting as they are controlled by a
Roby application.

Single robot navigation
-----------------

http://roby.rubyforge.org/videos/perception_loops.avi

What we see in this video is the perception loop (whose visible part is the DEM
building) being handled by Roby. The perception updates are triggered by Roby
on the basis of state events: they are triggered by the translation of the
robot and the change of heading, to reduce the number of times it is actually done.

Bi-robot navigation
-----------------

http://roby.rubyforge.org/videos/birobot.avi

What we see in this video is the cooperation between a rover and an UAV for a
navigation task. Both robots, as well as the common part of their joint plan is
written in and managed by Roby.  Including part of the data transfer process.
This bi-robot setup has also successfully been tested on real robots, with an
iRobot ATRV and a Yamaha RMAX helicopter.

In this video, the rover plans its path (the line on the ground) in a
traversability map (red/green map: red is non-traversable, green is
traversable). It also generates a set of regions of interest for him. Those
regions are then considered by the UAV which decides how it will schedule its
own perception. When the UAV does have perceived a zone, it informs the rover
and sends it the relevant data. The rover can then update its own map.

Error handling
---------------
Rflex repaired

This is a simple example of asynchronous repairs.  In this video, the
microcontroller which drives the robot's motors can give us spurious
<tt>BRAKES_ON</tt> messages. Our problem is that the Roby controller must
determine if the message is spurious, or if brakes are actually set by the means
of an emergency switch for instance. To do that, an error handling is set up,
which wait for a few seconds and tests the <tt>BRAKES_ON</tt> state of the
robot. If the brakes are reported as off, then the robot can start moving again.
Otherwise, the error was a rightful one and should be handled by other means.

P3d repaired
------------

http://roby.rubyforge.org/videos/p3d_repaired.avi.

In this video, the system handles a problem with DEM generation ("DEM" means
"Digital Elevation Map". It is a representation of the terrain the robot is on).
Due to localization issues, it is possible to have a very bad DEM in which the
robot cannot move. If that happens, the locomotion activity (P3d::Track) emits
the +blocked+ event. Our way to handle it in three steps:
1. a new DEM perception is done. As the robot is not moving, it should give a
   better result. This is called the "Stage 1 handler" in the video.
2. if the robot is still blocked, the "Stage 2 handler" completely reinitializes
   the DEM and do a local update.
3. if the fault remains, the problem does not lie in the DEM perception process,
   but in the fact that the robot is actually blocked. The error must therefore be
   handled by other means.

At all times, if the robot moves more than a given threshold, the problem was
actually the DEM perception process and the error handler is reset at the first
stage for following operations.
