title: Error handling
sort_info: 700
---

One thing about robotics, and in particular plan execution, is that Murphy's
rule applies quite well. This is due to a few things. Among them, the first is
that the models planning uses (and therefore the plans it builds) are (i) too
simple to completely reflect the reality, (ii) badly parametrized and (iii)
represent dynamic agents, which can themselves be able to take decisions. So, in
essence, the rule of thumb is that a plan will fail during its execution.

Because Roby represents and executes all the activities of a given system, the
representation of errors becomes a very powerful thing: it is quite easy, when
an error appears somewhere to actually determine what are its consequences.

What this tutorial will show is:
* how parts of the error conditions are encoded in the task structure.
* how exceptions that come from the code itself (like NoMethodError ...) are
  handled.

Failed dependencies
-------------------
The hierarchy relation, because it defines a dependency, also obviously defines
the situations where that dependency has failed. To describe this, the relation
options allow to define a set of _desirable_ and a set of _forbidden_ events.
The first category defines what the parent needs (task A desires the success
event of task B to be emitted). The second category defines what the parent is
incompatible with (task A will fail if task's B failed event is emitted).
Obviously, there is a problem if:
* none of the desirable events can be emitted ever
* one of the forbidden events is emitted

In both cases, a specific {rdoc_class: ChildFailedError} is produced. This error
describes what happened ("the dependency relation between tasks A and B failed
because the event 'failed' was emitted) and who is the culprit (in the
ChildFailedError, the child).

Let's see an example of such an error. We'll cheat a bit and make our
ComputePath task fail. Edit models/tasks/compute\_path.rb and add an error at the beginning of the implementation block. Make it so that it looks like the following:

{coderay:: ruby}
implementation do
  raise "implementation failed !"
  path      = [start_point]
{coderay}

Now, start the controller in one console and the roby shell in another and:

    localhost:48902 > planned_move! :x => 10, :y => 20
    !Roby::ChildFailedError
    !at [345013:53:51.812/109] in the failed event of ComputePath:0x7f6ff6a8f0a8
    !implementation failed ! (RuntimeError)
    !  ./models/tasks/compute_path.rb:19,
    !    /home/joyeux/dev/roby/lib/roby/thread_task.rb:63:in `value',
    !    /home/joyeux/dev/roby/lib/roby/thread_task.rb:63:in the polling handler,
    !    /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `gem_original_require',
    !    /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `require',
    !    scripts/run:3
    !
    !The failed relation is

    !    arguments: {:goal=>Vector3D(x=10.000000,y=20.000000,z=0.000000)}
    !  depends_on ComputePath:0x7f6ff6a8f0a8
    !    owners: Roby::Distributed
    !    arguments: {:path_task=>
    !      MoveTo:0x7f6ff6a8f198
    !        owners: Roby::Distributed
    !        arguments: {:goal=>Vector3D(x=10.000000,y=20.000000,z=0.000000)},
    !     :goal=>Vector3D(x=10.000000,y=20.000000,z=0.000000)}
    !
    !The following tasks have been killed:
    !  ComputePath:0x7f6ff6a8f0a8
    !  MoveTo:0x7f6ff6a8f198
    !
    !task MoveTo{goal => Vector3D(x=10.000000,y=20.000000,z=0.000000)}:0x7f6ff6a8f198[] failed

What information is there ?

* we do have a ChildFailedError
* the source is the emission at 345013:53:51.812/109 of the 'failed' event of
  ComputePath. Roby::ThreadTask will automatically emit _failed_ if the
  implementation block raises an exception (what we did). In that case, the
  context of _failed_ is the exception object itself.
* because the exception object is available, it is displayed, including
  its backtrace.

        !implementation failed ! (RuntimeError)
        !  ./models/tasks/compute_path.rb:19,
        !    /home/joyeux/dev/roby/lib/roby/thread_task.rb:63:in `value',
        !    /home/joyeux/dev/roby/lib/roby/thread_task.rb:63:in the polling handler,
        !    /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `gem_original_require',
        !    /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `require',
        !    scripts/run:3

* the two tasks involved in the failed relation are displayed as well. MoveTo is the parent, ComputePath is the child.
* finally, because nothing was done to repair the error, both the failed task
  _and its parents_ are **killed and removed from the plan**. This is because
  the parent tasks may not behave correctly given that one of their dependencies
  is not behaving properly. So, as a safety measure, we kill them. This is done by
  the garbage collection mechanism we presented along with the plan display.    
* the last line, announcing that the MoveTo task failed is not part of the
  exception message, but of the interactive shell that tells us that one of our
  missions has failed.

Coding mistakes
---------------
Roby tries very hard to separate the _framework_ code from the _user_
code, so that coding mistakes in user code can be dealt with in a safe manner.

The _user code_ is the part of the code which is tied to events and tasks:
event commands, event handlers, polling blocks. For those, it is actually
possible to generate a plan error, as for instance for the child failed error,
and to handle the error at the plan level.

The _framework code_ is the more problematic part: if an error appears here, it
means that there is really a bug in the execution engine itself (and therefore
that we can't rely on it). In that case, Roby tries to hang up as cleanly as
possible by killing all tasks that are being executed.

Let's try one code error. Add the following event handler in the definition of
MoveTo in models/tasks/move\_to.rb

{coderay:: ruby}
on :start do
  raise "the start handler failed !"
end
{coderay}

Start (or restart) the controller and launch a planned\_move! action in
the shell. The following should happen:

    = fatal exception 1: uncaught exception in an event handler of the start event of MoveTo:0x7f2c665a24b0
    | called during the propagation of [16:10:25.191 @2] MoveTo:0x7f2c665a24b0{goal => Vector3D(x=10.000000,y=20.000000,z=0.000000)}[]/start
    | /media/Data/rock/imoby/tutorials/roby/models/tasks/move_to.rb:10:in `event_handler_start_7f2c67500010': bla (RuntimeError)
    | ./models/tasks/move_to.rb:10:in event handler for 'start',
    |   /media/Data/rock/imoby/tools/roby/bin/roby:7
    | The following tasks have been killed:
    | MoveTo:0x7f2c665a24b0

Now, what happens during execution: how Roby does react to that error ? What we
can see in the relation display is that, just after the action got expanded, the
following happens:

![](log_replay/moveto_code_error.png)
{: .fullfigure}

The MoveTo is started, and therefore the event handler is called. Note that the
event is still propagated as it __already happened__. Because of the failure,
the task is killed by the garbage collection mechanism and the children are
stopped as well since they are not useful anymore
{: .caption}

For event commands, all depends on where the exception actually appears. If
'emit' has already been called, then the event will be emitted and propagated.
Otherwise, it counts as a cancelling of the event command -- which is also an error
itself.

Handling errors
---------------
This is more an advanced subject, but we'll give you an overview of the means
for error handling that Roby offers anyway. The basic principles are as follows:
* the plan structure should be sane. We saw what it means in the case of the
  hierarchy relation, but other relations also define what is a "nominal" plan
  structure. An error is raised if the current plan does not match that nominal
  structure.
* tasks for which coding errors have been detected must be terminated.
* anything that depends on a failed task must be terminated.

During the application's execution, the event propagation, error detection and
garbage detection are three distinct steps:

![](roby_cycle_overview.png)

So, if a broken plan structure is repaired in the event propagation stage, then
no errors will ever be emitted. Indeed, the error detection and handling stage
will not see the problem. **Repairing errors in event handlers** is a first mean of
error handling.

The error handling stage is actually split into two sub-stages:

* first, specific code blocks are called for each error found in the plan (these
  code blocks are called _exception handlers_)
* then, the structure is checked again and the errors that remain lead to
  garbage collection.

**Exception handlers** are the second mean of error handling.

Finally, sometime, recovering from an error requires complex actions (or
decision-making) that do not fit in one execution cycle. For those situations,
Roby allows to mark some tasks as being _plan repairs_: these tasks' job is to
repair specific errors. **Plan repairs** are the third mean of error handling.

Repairing during events propagation
-----------------------------------

If a child fails, for instance because of a spurious problem, it would have been
possible to actually restart the failing child directly in the event handler of
_failed_ and replace the failed task through this new one. This is as simple as:

{coderay:: ruby}
on(:failed) do
    plan.respawn(self)
end
{coderay}

Let's try it. Add the following to the definition of ExecutePath to simulate an
error:

{coderay:: ruby}
attr_accessor :should_pass
event :start do
  if !should_pass
    forward :start, self, :failed, :delay => 0.2
  end
  emit :start
end

on :failed do
  if !should_pass
    Robot.info "respawning ..."
    new_task = plan.respawn(self)
    new_task.should_pass = true
  end
end
{coderay}

In the first pass, #should\_pass is false and therefore the _delayed forwarding
relation_ is set up between start and failed. It means that _failed_ will be
emitted 0.2 seconds after _start_ (thus simulating a failing task).

In the _failed_ handler, a new ExecutePath task is re-created with the same
arguments using Plan#respawn. On this task, #should\_pass is set to true so that
the execution continues normally.

Note that doing such a thing on the failed event is a bad idea, as failed is
emitted when the task gets interrupted. You would, in general, do that on a more
specific error event (i.e. an event that is forwarded to _failed_).

Asynchronous repairs
--------------------

In Roby's plans, asynchronous repairs are represented as _plan repairs_. Plan
repairs are tasks which are associated with a task's event. When the task's
event is the source of a failure, the task is activated and should repair that
particular error.

To define plan repairs, a ErrorHandling relation exists. This relation defines
the set of possible plan repairs for a given task and event. To define a
specific repair, one uses something like:

{coderay:: ruby}
task.event(error_event_name).handle_with(my_repair_task)
{coderay}

Let's try it in our application. What we will do is the following:

* add a _blocked_ fault event to the model of ExecutePath, and make the poll
  block of ExecutePath emit _blocked_ randomly.
* have a repair task wait 2 seconds and either (randomly) respawn the path
  execution after those two seconds, or emit _failed_.

The first point is straightforward: just change models/tasks/execute\_path.rb so that
the bottom of it looks like the following code. Changed lines are 4, 5, 10 and
11.

{coderay:: {lang: ruby, line_numbers: true}}
    if @waypoint_index == path_task.path.size
      emit :success
    elsif rand < 0.05
        emit :blocked
    end
    Robot.info "moved to #{current_waypoint}"
  end

  event :blocked
  forward :blocked => :failed
end
{coderay}

A new RepairTask model has to be added. Open models/tasks/repair\_task.rb and add the
following:

{coderay:: ruby}
class RepairTask < Roby::Task
  terminates

  event :start do
    Robot.info "repair will succeed in 2 seconds"
    forward_to :start, self, :success, :delay => 2
    emit :start
  end

  on :success do
    current   = failed_task.current_waypoint
    execute   = plan.respawn(failed_task)
    repair    = plan.recreate(self)
    execute.blocked_event.handle_with(repair)

    # Get the path object, and remove the points that have already been done
    path = execute.parent_task.path
    while !path.empty? && path[0] != current
        path.shift
    end
  end
end
{coderay}

Finally, the repair handler must be defined added to the plan. Edit the
planned\_move method in <tt>planners/goForward/main.rb</tt> and add the
following line to it:

{coderay:: ruby}
execute.event(:blocked).handle_with(RepairTask.new)
{coderay}

Let's run it as usual and see what happens ... In the Roby shell, do

    >> planned_move! :x => 10, :y => 20

Then, take a look at the application output

    24 points between Vector3D(x=0.000000,y=0.000000,z=0.000000) and Vector3D(x=10.000000,y=20.000000,z=0.000000)

Each time the task failed, the repair task was started and repaired the plan.
Note that the task also adds a copy of itself to the plan. Let's look at it in
more details in the plan display (note that this time, you need to display the
ErrorHandling relation as well).

A simple real-world example is
[here](http://roby.rubyforge.org/videos/rflex_repaired.avi) In this video, the
microcontroller which drives the robot's motors sometime gives spurious
<tt>BRAKES_ON</tt> messages. Our problem is that the Roby controller must
determine if the message is spurious, or if brakes are actually set by the means
of an emergency switch for instance. To do that, the plan waits a few seconds
and tests the <tt>BRAKES_ON</tt> state of the robot. If the brakes are reported
as off, then the robot can start moving again. Otherwise, the error was a
rightful one and should be handled by other means.

Another, more complex example is the "P3d repaired" video presented
[here](http://roby.rubyforge.org/videos/p3d_repaired.avi)

Exception propagation
---------------------
This is the third error handling paradigm available in Roby. It is akin to
classical exception propagation. This mean of error handling is more advanced,
and therefore is not presented in detail here.

Unhandled errors
----------------
Once the exception propagation phase is finished, the plan analysis (i.e.
constraint verification) is re-ran once to verify that exception handlers do
have repaired the errors. If errors are still found, they cannot be handled
anymore.

This set of errors, and the errors that have not been handled before, determine
a set of tasks that can be dangerous for the whole system. The garbage
collection kicks in and will take the necessary actions to remove these tasks
from the plan. Indeed, it is necessary to kill all tasks which were actually
depending on the faulty activities: all tasks that are parents of the faulty
tasks in any relation are forcefully garbage collected. In the exception
propagation example above, all tasks which have a number will be killed and
remove from the plan.
