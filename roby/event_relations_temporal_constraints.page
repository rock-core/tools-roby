Available as Roby::EventStructure::TemporalConstraints

See {rdoc_class: EventStructure::TemporalConstraintsGraphClass::Extension} for the list
of methods that are defined on Roby::EventGenerator and
{rdoc_class: EventStructure::TemporalConstraintsGraphClass} for the methods accessible on the
relation graph.

Semantics
---------
This relation allows to encode two type of related constraints:

  * temporal relationships such as __emission of event 1 should happen within 2
    minutes of emission of event 2__.
  * constraints of occurence, such as __event 1 should be emitted at least twice
    before event 2 is emitted__

The temporal constraints are added with #add_temporal_constraint:

{coderay:: ruby}
# Specifies that if +ev1+ is emitted, then +ev2+ should be emitted within [0.2,
# 10] seconds. Note that emitting ev2 alone is fine.
ev1.add_temporal_constraint(ev2, 0.2, 10)
{coderay}

The exact semantic of the temporal constraint is one of a forward relation: it
constrains the emission of the target event __if__ the source event is emitted.

The second type of constraints allows to force the issue: one can specify with
__occurence constraints__ that, for ev2 to be emitted, ev1 should have be
emitted a certain number of times.

{coderay:: ruby}
# Specifies that +ev2+ can be emitted only if +ev1+ has already been emitted at
# least once. If an upper bound is needed, give it as second option
ev1.add_occurence_constraint(ev2, 1)
ev1.add_occurence_constraint(ev2, 1, 10)
{coderay}

The most common case (by far) is to specify an ordering between two events. This
is done by #should_emit_after:

{coderay:: ruby}
ev2.should_emit_after(ev1)
# Equivalent to
#    ev1.add_occurence_constraint(ev2, 1)
#    ev1.add_temporal_constraint(ev2, 0, Infinity)
{coderay}

There is also a shortcut between tasks with #should_start_after

{coderay:: ruby}
task.should_start_after(event_or_task)
{coderay}

Error Conditions
----------------
The temporal constraint relation has two ways to report error:

 * an event is emitted outside of its allowed range. Either
   TemporalConstraintViolation or OccurenceConstraintViolation errors are
   injected in the plan, using the event as their source.
 * an event has not been emitted but should have according to the temporal
   constraints. In the ev1.add_temporal_constraint(ev2, 0.2, 10) example, ev2
   did not emit after 10 seconds of ev1's emission. The MissedDeadlineError
   error is generated, with the relevant generator as its source point.

Relationship to Scheduling
--------------------------
The temporal constraint relation has an influence on [the temporal
scheduler](../advanced_concepts/scheduling.html).
