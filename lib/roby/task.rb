    # In a plan, Task objects represent the system's activities.
    #
    # === Task models
    #
    # A task model is mainly described by:
    #
    # <b>a set of named arguments</b>, which are required to parametrize the
    # task instance. The argument list is described using Task.argument and
    # arguments are either set at object creation by passing an argument hash
    # to Task.new, or by calling Task#argument explicitely.
    #
    # <b>a set of events</b>, which are situations describing the task
    # progression.  The base Roby::Task model defines the
    # +start+,+success+,+failed+ and +stop+ events. Events can be defined on
    # the models by using Task.event:
    #
    #   class MyTask < Roby::Task
    #       event :intermediate_event
    #   end
    #
    # defines a non-controllable event, i.e. an event which can be emitted, but
    # cannot be triggered explicitely by the system. Controllable events are defined
    # by associating a block of code with the event, this block being responsible for
    # making the event emitted either in the future or just now. For instance,
    #
    #   class MyTask < Roby::Task
    #       event :intermediate_event do |context|
    #           emit :intermediate_event
    #       end
    #
    #       event :other_event do |context|
    #           execution_engine.once { emit :other_event }
    #       end
    #   end
    #
    # define two controllable event. In the first case, the event is
    # immediately emitted, and in the second case it will be emitted at the
    # beginning of the next execution cycle.
    #
    # === Task relations
    #
    # Task relations are defined in the TaskStructure Relations::Space instance.
    # See TaskStructure documentation for the list of special methods defined
    # by the various graphs, and the TaskStructure namespace for the name and
    # purpose of the various relation graphs themselves.
    #
    # === Executability
    #
    # By default, a task is not executable, which means that no event command
    # can be called and no event can be emitted. A task becomes executable
    # either because Task#executable= has explicitely been called or because it
    # has been inserted in a Plan object. Note that forcing executability with
    # #executable= is only useful for testing. When the Roby controller manages
    # a real systems, the executability property enforces the constraint that a
    # task cannot be executed outside of the plan supervision.
    #
    # Finally, it is possible to describe _abstract_ task models: tasks which
    # do represent an action, but for which the _means_ to perform that action
    # are still unknown. This is done by calling Task.abstract in the task definition:
    #
    #   class AbstTask < Roby::Task
    #       abstract
    #   end
    #
    # An instance of an abstract model cannot be executed, even if it is included
    # in a plan.
    #
    # === Inheritance rules
    #
    # On task models, a submodel can inherit from a parent model if the actions
    # described by the parent model are also performed by the child model. For
    # instance, a <tt>Goto(x, y)</tt> model could be subclassed into a
    # <tt>Goto::ByFoot(x, y)</tt> model.
    #
    # The following constraints apply when subclassing a task model:
    # * a task subclass has at least the same events than the parent class
    # * changes to event attributes are limited. The rules are:
    #   - a controlable event must remain controlable. Nonetheless, a
    #     non-controlable event can become a controlable one
    #   - a terminal event (i.e. a terminal event which ends the task
    #     execution) cannot become non-terminal. Nonetheless, a non-terminal
    #     event can become terminal.
    #
    # @!macro InstanceHandlerOptions
    #   @option options [:copy,:drop] :on_replace defines the behaviour
    #      when this object gets replaced in the plan. If :copy is used,
    #      the handler is added to the replacing task and is also kept
    #      in the original task. If :drop, it is not copied (but is
    #      kept).
