    # This task represents a separate thread in the plan. At definition, the
    # thread's implementation is defined using the +implementation+ statement:
    #
    #   class MyThread < ThreadTask
    #     implementation do
    #       do_some_stuff
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # The task will emit +failed+ if the given block raises an exception,
    # and emit +success+ otherwise. In that latter case, the returned value
    # is saved in the +result+ attribute.
    #
    # By default, the task is not interruptible (i.e. +stop+ is not
    # controllable). The +interruptible+ statement allows to change that, in
    # which case, the thread must either check for
    # {#interruption_requested?}, or call #interruption_point explicitely,
    # when the interruption can be safely performed by raising an exception.
