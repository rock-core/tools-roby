## a common robot class with minor modifications

# require 'config/robots/robot_class'

    # Relative paths are resolved from the root of this app
    # Roby.app.register_app('../separate_path')

# Block evaluated to load the models this robot requires
Robot.requires do

# Block evaluated to configure the system, that is set up values in Roby's Conf
# and State
Robot.config do

# Setup of the robot's main action interface
#
# Add use statements here, as e.g.
#
#   use_library <%= Roby.app.module_name %>::Actions::MyActionInterface
#
# or, if you're using syskit
#
#   use_profile <%= Roby.app.module_name %>::Profiles::BaseProfile

# Block evaluated when the Roby app is fully setup, and the robot ready to
# start. This is where one usually adds permanent tasks and/or status lines
