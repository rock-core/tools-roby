Notations
---------
In the following pages, the example code is meant to be run either in a Ruby
shell or in a normal Unix shell. The following notations are used for these code
samples:

* "$" represents the prompt of the Unix shell. Code that is after it is
  therefore supposed to be written by you.
* ">>" represents the Ruby shell prompt. Code that is after ">>" is therefore
  supposed to be written by you
* '#' is a comment marker we use to display some information about the example
  code
* '=>' is the result of the previously entered command. It is omitted in the
  examples if that information is not useful for the purpose of the example
  itself.
* lines that start with nothing are lines that are displayed by the Ruby code

Setting up the Ruby shell
-------------------------
Moreover, before typing in the Roby shell, you will need to prepare it a bit. Do
the following:

{coderay:: text}
$ irb -rroby/standalone
{coderay}

{coderay:: ruby}
>> plan = Roby.plan
{coderay}
